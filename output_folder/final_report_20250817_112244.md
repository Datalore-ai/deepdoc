## 2. Literature Review on Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP)
The literature review serves as a foundational analysis of existing research in the field of Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP), a technique that integrates visual and textual information to enhance performance on tasks requiring comprehension of both modalities. This section synthesizes key findings, theoretical frameworks, and empirical studies, while also identifying gaps in the current literature that warrant further investigation.

### 2.1 Comprehensive Overview of Existing Research
#### Theoretical Frameworks
The theoretical foundations of VLP are rooted in cognitive science and machine learning principles that emphasize the integration of multimodal information. Central to this framework is the concept of **knowledge-enhanced image captioning**, which aims to improve the quality of image descriptions by leveraging relevant knowledge.

#### Empirical Studies
Recent empirical studies have highlighted both the advancements and challenges associated with VLP. Research has identified issues such as **knowledge hallucination**, where pre-trained models produce inaccurate information due to the presence of noisy training data. Furthermore, studies reveal that models fine-tuned on datasets with limited semantic diversity exhibit **generic bias**, inhibiting their ability to convey nuanced knowledge effectively.

Innovative approaches, such as **Knowledge-guided Replay (K-Replay)**, have been proposed to mitigate these challenges. K-Replay retains pre-training knowledge during the fine-tuning process by utilizing a curated set of knowledge-related images, thereby enhancing memory retention and improving description accuracy.

#### Methodological Approaches
The literature reflects a diverse array of methodological approaches in VLP research, encompassing qualitative analyses of model performance and quantitative evaluations using benchmarks like the KnowCap dataset.
